Image Classification Project
Using supervised algorithm with Keras and TensorFlow. This is a ongoing project that uses deep learning to identify SEM (scanning electron microscope) images of spiders. The images are divided in 6 categories (chelicerae, eyes, legs, palp, spinnerets, and trichobothia), which are used to describe important features in spider morphology. As a ongoing project, the images used are not going to be public in this repository.
